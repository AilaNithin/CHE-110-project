  <section>
    <h2>Solar Energy</h2>
    <p>Solar energy is a renewable energy source that harnesses the power of the sun to produce electricity.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Renewable Source: Solar energy is a renewable and sustainable energy source that is derived from the sun's radiation.</li>
        <li>Photovoltaic Cells: Solar panels use photovoltaic cells to convert sunlight directly into electricity. These cells are made of semiconductor materials like silicon.</li>
        <li>Clean and Green: Solar power generation produces minimal environmental impact compared to conventional energy sources. It does not emit greenhouse gases or other pollutants during operation.</li>
        <li>Reduced Electricity Bills: Installing solar panels on residential or commercial buildings can lead to a significant reduction in electricity bills by harnessing the sun's energy for power needs.</li>
        <li>Technological Advancements: Ongoing research and technological advancements continue to improve the efficiency and affordability of solar panels, making them more accessible to a broader audience.</li>
        <li>Solar Thermal Power: In addition to photovoltaic cells, solar energy can also be harnessed through solar thermal power systems that use mirrors or lenses to concentrate sunlight and generate steam to drive turbines for electricity generation.</li>
        <li>Global Potential: Solar energy has vast global potential, and as technology advances and costs decrease, it plays a crucial role in transitioning towards a more sustainable and clean energy future.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Wind Energy</h2>
    <p>Wind energy is generated by harnessing the power of the wind through wind turbines to produce electricity.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Renewable Resource: Wind energy is a renewable and sustainable energy source that harnesses the power of the wind to generate electricity.</li>
        <li>Wind Turbines: Wind energy is primarily captured using wind turbines. These turbines have blades that rotate when exposed to the wind, converting the kinetic energy into electrical power through a generator.</li>
        <li>Reduced Dependency on Fossil Fuels: Wind energy helps reduce dependency on traditional fossil fuels, contributing to energy diversification and enhancing energy security.</li>
        <li>Low Operating Costs: Once installed, wind turbines have relatively low operating and maintenance costs, making them economically attractive for long-term power generation.</li>
        <li>Global Potential: Wind energy has vast global potential, especially in regions with consistent wind patterns. Continued advancements in turbine technology and increased investment contribute to the growth of wind power worldwide.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Hydroelectric Power</h2>
    <p>Hydroelectric power is generated by the movement of water, usually from dams or river currents, to produce electricity.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Renewable Energy Source: Hydroelectric power is a renewable and sustainable energy source that harnesses the energy of flowing or falling water to generate electricity.</li>
        <li>Dams and Reservoirs: Hydroelectric power plants typically involve the construction of dams on rivers. These dams create reservoirs, storing water that can be released in a controlled manner to drive turbines.</li>
        
        <li>Turbines and Generators: The kinetic energy of flowing water is converted into mechanical energy by turbines. These turbines, connected to generators, produce electricity as they spin.</li>
        <li>Long Lifecycle: Hydroelectric power plants often have a long operational life, ranging from several decades to over a century, with proper maintenance.</li>
        <li>Environmental Impact: While hydroelectric power is relatively clean, the construction of large dams can have environmental consequences, including changes to local ecosystems, displacement of communities, and altered river flow patterns.</li>
